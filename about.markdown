## Ronny Landsverk (me) and my entourage
![Profile-Picture]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profilePic.jpg)
# I have a MSc degree of engineering in mechatronics, and rather than to follow tutorials on YouTube I prefer consisely written tutorials in document form. 

# This blog will have a mixed contents with basic tutorials about topics that I find useful and interesting.

I can't promise to bring anything new to the table, but I promise that if I post something then I'll include every detail required to finish. 
That being said, we should remember that software gets updated, so commands that would run for two months ago may not run smoothly today and I will not promise that the content is up to date.
